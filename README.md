## The Big Picture
You're setting up a test environment for an AI training system called Templar. Think of it as a mini version of what runs in production. Here's what the system does:
- Blockchain (Subtensor): Manages rewards and coordination between AI models
- Validator: Checks the quality of AI models' work
- Miners: AI models that do the actual training/learning
- You're testing: Whether they all work together correctly
